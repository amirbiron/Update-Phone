# Security Notes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. MongoDB Connection - useNewUrlParser Deprecation ✅

**Issue:** The deprecated `useNewUrlParser` parameter was being used in MongoDB connection configuration.

**Fix Applied:** Removed the `useNewUrlParser: true` parameter from the mongoose.connect options in `src/database.js`.

**Before:**
```javascript
await mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
await mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});
```

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - The parameter has been successfully removed.

## Known Issues

### 2. npm Vulnerabilities - node-telegram-bot-api Dependencies ⚠️

**Issue:** 4 moderate severity vulnerabilities related to the deprecated `request` package.

**Root Cause:** The `node-telegram-bot-api@0.66.0` package still depends on deprecated packages:
- `@cypress/request-promise` 
- `request-promise-core`
- `request` (deprecated since 2020)

**Vulnerability Details:**
```
request  *
Severity: moderate
Server-Side Request Forgery in Request - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6
```

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Ran `npm audit fix` - no automatic fix available
2. ✅ Tried `npm audit fix --force` - would downgrade to v0.63.0 (breaking change)
3. ✅ Removed problematic overrides from package.json
4. ✅ Updated to latest version (0.66.0)

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
- The vulnerabilities are **moderate severity** (not critical)
- The package is actively maintained but still uses legacy dependencies
- These are transitive dependencies that don't directly affect application security in typical usage

**Recommendations:**
1. **Monitor** for updates to `node-telegram-bot-api` that address these dependencies
2. **Consider alternatives** like `telegraf` or `node-telegram-bot-api-v2` if vulnerabilities become critical
3. **Document** this as a known technical debt item
4. **Review periodically** (every 3-6 months) for package updates

**Risk Assessment:** 
- **Low to Medium** - These are Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities in a deprecated HTTP client
- The bot application typically doesn't make arbitrary HTTP requests based on user input
- The vulnerabilities require specific attack vectors that are unlikely in this use case

- [x] Remove deprecated MongoDB connection parameters
- [x] Update npm dependencies where possible
- [x] Document known vulnerabilities and their risk assessment
- [ ] Set up automated security monitoring (future improvement)
- [ ] Regular security audit schedule (quarterly recommended)
